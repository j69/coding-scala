## Run tests

## Code formatting

I use `scalafmt` (IDE settings + gradle's plugin to start it)

#### Good references worth to check
* [Twitterâ€™s Effective Scala](http://twitter.github.io/effectivescala/) <-- more Scal'ish
* [Databricks Scala Guide](https://github.com/databricks/scala-style-guide) <-- less Scal'ish
* [The Official Scala Style Guide](http://docs.scala-lang.org/style)

I use such settings:

since it looks like IntelJ too often use its own formatter instead `scalafmt` to optimise performance that could easily cause different results.
